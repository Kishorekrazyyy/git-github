Title: Kubernetes Deployment Project: Sample 2048 Game with EKS, Ingress Controller, Prometheus, and Grafana

Introduction:
Join me on a journey through a comprehensive Kubernetes deployment project where I showcase the setup of a sample 2048 game application leveraging Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service). This project integrates various Kubernetes components such as Ingress Controller, Prometheus for monitoring, and Grafana for visualization.
